        <h1>What Bear Framework is not?</h1>
        <p>
            Bear Framework is not your average framework. It doesn't have MVC build it - not all of us use it, and not all web apps require it. It doesn't have ORM build in - there are many different databases and libraries available. It doesn't have template engine build in - there are many different choices.
        </p>
        <h2>The ultimate framework</h2>
        <p>
            Rather than making it too specific, we've decided to make a framework that has great core and ability to be extended easily to fit your specific needs. You can easily use your favorite libraries, template engines and database clients.
        </p>
        <h2>Framework that requires strict way of coding</h2>
        <p>
            Bear Framework does not require you to spend countless hours on tutorials, just to make a simple todo app. We believe basic HTML and PHP knowledge is enough to do your job, and Bear Framework should help you do this more efficiently.
        </p>
        <h2>Build to sell books and conference tickets</h2>
        <p>
            Bear Framework's only goal is to be useful and to make you more productive as a developer. It will be cool if some day there are branded T-shirts and hoodies and even an official Bear Framework conference, but this is not the goal.
